-- | A mutable label.  Consists of a static label on the label, a
-- mutable label, and a list of threads currently accessing the label.
-- This is intended to be used by privileged code implementing @IO@
-- abstractions with mutable labels.  Routines for accessing such an
-- @IO@ abstraction should perform tne @IO@ from within a call to
-- 'withMLabelP', to ensure an exception is raised if another thread
-- revokes access with 'modifyMLabelP'.
